my code:

#include <stdio.h>

int main()

{

    int a=3;

    double const b=4;

    float c=1.5;

    char d='A';

    printf("The value of a is %d\n",a);

    printf("The value of a is %.2lf\n",b);

    printf("The value of a is %.2f\n",c);

    printf("The value of a is %c\n",d);

    return 0;

}

my output:

The value of a is 3
The value of a is 4.00
The value of a is 1.50
